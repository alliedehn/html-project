                    Wassup, learners! I am Leigh Marie Panuncialman, a 20-year-old first-year BS Information Technology student at the University of San Carlos. When I‚Äôm not busy with my studies, I‚Äôm all about living life to the fullest‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs spiking on the volleyball court, jamming to my favorite tunes, going on exciting adventures, or singing my heart out. Oh, and I absolutely adore the colors pink and red‚Äîthey totally match my vibrant and passionate personality! I hope you can learn the lessons under CIS 1102N with the help of my websites. Let‚Äôs learn, grow, and make every moment meaningful. Let us Learn By Heart! üíó
